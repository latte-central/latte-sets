  "Partial functions are defined in this namespace as
  relations (in the type theoretic sense) of type
  `(==> T U :type)` together with a domain `dom` of type `(set T)`
  and a codomain `cod` of type `(set U)`
   such that for any element of the domain there is a unique
  image in the codomain.

  **Remark**: in type theory, it is best to rely on total functions because
  these are 'native' through the function type `==>`. 
  Partial functions are encoded and thus more complex and less 'natural', however
  there are needed for many related (and set-theoretic) concepts (e.g. finite sets)."
